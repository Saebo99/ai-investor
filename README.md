# AI Investor

**Short description:** The AI investor is an agentic investor that uses fundamental analysis in order to find the optimal long-term stocks to invest in.
It also keeps up with news, numbers, results, etc. in order to continuously update its portfolio. 
It will use MCP tools in order to both perform the necessary research on stocks, follow latest news, keep track of its portfolio, and actually do the investing of available capital.

These are its fundamental strategic points:
1. Never invest in risky assets. "Monopolies"/large companies that still have high upside long-term, are preferred in order to reduce risk.
2. The goal is always to find stocks that can be held for a several months to several years.
3. Stocks distributing dividends are preferred.
4. Diversification, in both number of companies and number of industries, is key without spreading too thin.
