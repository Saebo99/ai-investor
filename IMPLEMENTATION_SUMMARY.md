# Implementation Summary: Claude Agent with MCP Tools

## Problem Statement
The user requested to transform the AI Investor system to allow a Claude agent to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for:
1. Fetching Nordnet positions
2. Fetching available funds in the Nordnet account
3. Fetching information from EODHD
4. Determining whether a stock is a buy/hold/etc.
5. Actually executing mocked buy/sell/hold actions
6. Sending an email report with thought processes and decisions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Nordnet Client
**File**: `src/ai_investor/broker/nordnet_client.py`
- Added `get_available_funds()` method to fetch available cash and account value
- Returns currency, available cash, total value, and invested value
- Works in mock mode for testing without real API credentials

### 2. MCP Tool Definitions
**File**: `src/ai_investor/agents/mcp_tools.py`
Created 7 tools with proper MCP schema format:

1. **get_nordnet_positions**: Fetch current holdings
2. **get_available_funds**: Check available cash
3. **get_stock_fundamentals**: Get financial metrics from EODHD
4. **get_stock_news**: Fetch recent news articles
5. **evaluate_stock_decision**: Generate investment thesis
6. **execute_trade**: Place buy/sell orders (mocked)
7. **get_shortlist**: Get pre-screened dividend stocks

Also created `MCPToolExecutor` class to bridge tool calls to actual implementations.

### 3. Enhanced Claude Agent
**File**: `src/ai_investor/agents/claude_agent.py`
- Added `run_with_tools()` method for agentic tool-calling loop
- Supports up to 25 iterations (configurable)
- Handles tool execution, errors, and conversation management
- Returns complete result with content, iterations, and tool call history

### 4. Agent Orchestrator
**File**: `src/ai_investor/agents/agent_orchestrator.py`
- Created `AgentOrchestrator` class to manage the agent workflow
- Configures Claude with investment strategy system prompt
- Initializes all necessary clients (Nordnet, EODHD, DecisionEngine, etc.)
- Creates tool executor and runs agent loop
- Formats comprehensive email reports with agent reasoning

### 5. Service Integration
**File**: `src/ai_investor/orchestration/service.py`
- Added new CLI command: `ai-investor run-agent`
- Executes agent-based workflow
- Displays results in console
- Sends email report with analysis and decisions

### 6. Comprehensive Tests
**Directory**: `tests/`
Created test suite covering:
- `test_mcp_tools.py`: Tool schemas and executor functionality
- `test_nordnet_client.py`: New funds method
- `test_agent_orchestrator.py`: Orchestrator behavior
- All tests use mocks to avoid requiring real API credentials

### 7. Documentation
**Files**: `README.md`, `docs/mcp_tools.md`
- Updated README with agent-based workflow explanation
- Created comprehensive MCP tools architecture guide
- Documented all tools with examples
- Explained agent workflow and system prompt
- Added usage instructions and configuration details

## Key Features

### Autonomous Decision Making
- Agent fetches portfolio state independently
- Analyzes stocks using multiple data sources
- Makes buy/hold/trim/exit decisions
- Executes trades based on conviction thresholds

### Long-Term Investment Focus
- 90-day minimum holding period before considering exits
- Higher threshold for new positions (0.75) to avoid trend-chasing
- More lenient thresholds for existing positions (0.45)
- Stability scoring rewards low debt and low volatility
- Dividend preference built into screening

### Safe Testing Environment
- All trades are mocked
- No real money involved
- Comprehensive logging of all decisions
- Email reports for transparency

### Tool-Based Architecture
- Modular MCP tool design
- Easy to add new tools
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable components

## Usage

### Run Agent-Based Workflow
```bash
# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run the agent
ai-investor run-agent
```

The agent will:
1. Fetch current positions and funds
2. Get shortlist of candidate stocks
3. Analyze each stock (fundamentals + news)
4. Evaluate investment decisions
5. Execute high-conviction trades (mocked)
6. Send email report with reasoning

### Email Report Format
The agent sends a comprehensive email including:
- Analysis date and agent statistics
- Agent's reasoning and decisions
- Tool execution summary
- Any errors or issues
- Professional formatting with clear sections

## Technical Details

### Agent System Prompt
The agent is configured with investment principles:
- Focus on long-term value
- Prefer dividend-paying large caps
- Consider stability as important as growth
- Respect minimum holding periods
- Document reasoning clearly

### Tool Execution Flow
1. Agent decides which tool to use
2. Claude formats tool call with proper parameters
3. Tool executor maps call to implementation
4. Result returned to agent as JSON
5. Agent continues analysis or provides final answer

### Error Handling
- Tools catch and report errors gracefully
- Agent can continue if some tools fail
- All errors logged and included in email report
- Maximum iteration limit prevents infinite loops

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest tests/
```

### Test Coverage
- Tool schema validation
- Tool executor functionality
- Nordnet client enhancements
- Agent orchestrator behavior
- Email report formatting

## Security

### Code Security Review
✅ Passed automated code review
- Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` usage
- Updated to modern type hints
- No security vulnerabilities detected

### CodeQL Analysis
✅ Passed CodeQL security scanning
- No alerts found
- Clean security posture

### Safe Defaults
- Mock mode enabled by default
- No real trades without explicit configuration
- API credentials loaded from environment only
- Email delivery requires explicit configuration

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real Nordnet API**: Implement actual trading (currently mocked)
2. **Streaming Responses**: Handle large data sets more efficiently
3. **Tool Caching**: Avoid redundant API calls
4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents for different tasks
5. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket support for live data
6. **Portfolio Optimization**: Consider correlation and sector exposure
7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Identify strategic exit opportunities

### Configuration Tuning
- Minimum holding period (currently 90 days)
- Conviction thresholds (buy: 0.75, hold: 0.45)
- Stability weight (currently 15%)
- Maximum iterations (currently 25)

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully transforms the AI Investor into an autonomous agent-based system using Claude with MCP tools. The agent can:

✅ Fetch portfolio positions and funds
✅ Retrieve stock fundamentals and news
✅ Evaluate investment decisions with multi-factor analysis
✅ Execute mocked trades based on high conviction
✅ Send comprehensive email reports with reasoning

All trades are safely mocked for testing, and the system includes comprehensive tests, documentation, and security validation. The modular tool-based architecture makes it easy to extend and maintain.
