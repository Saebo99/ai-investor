# AI Investor Strategy

The AI Investor server follows a conservative, long-term oriented strategy that emphasises stable growth, resilient balance sheets, and predictable cash flows.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Long-term compounding**  
   Focus on businesses with durable competitive advantages, consistent revenue growth, and clear reinvestment opportunities.

2. **Risk-aware allocation**  
   Avoid speculative positions and concentrate on companies with strong fundamentals, diversified revenue, and low leverage.

3. **Dividend-friendly holdings**  
   Prefer firms that return capital via dividends or buybacks and have a history of sustainable payout ratios.

4. **Ethical considerations**  
   Exclude companies whose core business models rely on weapons, tobacco, gambling, or other sectors that conflict with the investor's values.

5. **Secular growth sectors**  
   Prioritize technology, healthcare, renewable energy, and other industries with long-term tailwinds, while focusing on established market leaders.

6. **Valuation discipline**  
   Screen out companies exhibiting extreme valuation multiples relative to their growth profile, or where key ratios indicate overvaluation.

## Decision Heuristics

- **Strengthen core positions** when valuation remains reasonable (e.g., forward P/E below 30 for megacaps) and long-term outlook is intact.
- **Rebalance or trim** if a holding materially exceeds target weights or deteriorates in fundamentals (rising debt, slowing growth, etc.).
- **Deploy available funds** into shortlist candidates that meet valuation and quality thresholds, especially when macro indicators (e.g., Fear & Greed Index) favour risk-on positioning.
- **Hold cash** or rotate into defensive large caps when sentiment is excessively greedy and valuations are stretched.

These rules guide the automated advice produced by the MCP server and can be adapted as new data sources are added.
